{"topic": "DSA", "context": "Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science that involve the organization and manipulation of data. Data structures are ways to store and organize data efficiently, while algorithms are step-by-step procedures for performing computations or solving problems. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Algorithms can be categorized into various types such as sorting algorithms (like quicksort and mergesort), searching algorithms (like binary search), and graph algorithms (like Dijkstra's algorithm).", "language": "English", "question_type": "Multiple Choice", "seniority": "Intern", "questions": "What is the primary purpose of data structures in computer science?\nName three common types of data structures.\nWhat is an algorithm in the context of computer science?\nWhat is the function of Dijkstra's algorithm?", "length": 4}
