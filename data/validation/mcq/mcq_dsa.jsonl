{"topic": "DSA", "context": "Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science that involve the organization and manipulation of data. Data structures are ways to store and organize data efficiently, while algorithms are step-by-step procedures for performing computations or solving problems.
